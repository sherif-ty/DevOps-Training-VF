<h2>1. Introduction to DevOps</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.plesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DevOps-1.png" alt="Introduction to DevOps"></p>
<p>DevOps is a set of practices that unifies software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle while delivering high-quality software continuously.</p>
<h2>2. Why DevOps?</h2><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*x-TZmDtHUZVEaQqQU8gShw.png" alt="Why DevOps" width="600">
<ul>
  <li>Reduce development cycle time.</li>
  <li>Faster delivery of features and fixes.</li>
  <li>Improved collaboration between development and operations teams.</li>
  <li>Minimized human errors through automation.</li>
  <li>Increased deployment frequency and faster time to market.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. DevOps Roadmap</h2><img src="https://roadmap.sh/roadmaps/devops.png" alt="DevOps Roadmap" width="600">
<h3>3.1 Key Phases of the DevOps Lifecycle</h3><img src="https://xebialabs.com/wp-content/uploads/files/tool-chest/devops-toolchain.png" alt="DevOps Lifecycle" width="600">
<ul>
  <li><b>Continuous Integration (CI):</b> Developers frequently integrate code into a shared repository, ensuring early detection of bugs.</li>
  <li><b>Continuous Delivery (CD):</b> Automates the release of validated code to a staging environment or production.</li>
  <li><b>Continuous Testing:</b> Automatically runs tests on new code to ensure high-quality output.</li>
  <li><b>Continuous Monitoring:</b> Tracks application performance and error logs to provide actionable insights.</li>
  <li><b>Infrastructure as Code (IaC):</b> Automates infrastructure setup using code (e.g., Terraform, Ansible).</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. DevOps Tools</h2><img src="https://d3n817fwly711g.cloudfront.net/uploads/2017/11/devops_tools.png" alt="DevOps Tools" width="600">
<p>The following are some tools widely used in each phase of the DevOps lifecycle:</p>

<h2>5. DevOps Maturity Model</h2><img src="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DevOps-Maturity-Model.png" alt="DevOps Maturity Model" width="600">
<p>DevOps maturity describes an organizationâ€™s ability to perform DevOps practices effectively. There are five key stages of DevOps maturity:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Level 1 - Initial:</b> Teams are siloed, and processes are manual.</li>
  <li><b>Level 2 - Managed:</b> Development and operations teams begin collaborating, but with manual handoffs.</li>
  <li><b>Level 3 - Defined:</b> Teams adopt CI/CD practices, but not fully automated.</li>
  <li><b>Level 4 - Quantitatively Managed:</b> Automation in place with visibility into metrics and monitoring.</li>
  <li><b>Level 5 - Optimized:</b> Fully automated pipeline with integrated monitoring, infrastructure as code, and continuous feedback loops.</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. DevOps Solves Key Issues</h2><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*wuOH7n4ytWoGqEJ6M5BXnA.png" alt="DevOps Problems Solved" width="600">
<p>DevOps addresses the following challenges in traditional software development:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Slow Releases:</b> Automating testing, integration, and delivery, DevOps speeds up software releases.</li>
  <li><b>Unreliable Deployments:</b> Continuous testing and automated deployment pipelines reduce human errors and ensure consistent results.</li>
  <li><b>Poor Collaboration:</b> DevOps fosters collaboration between developers, QA, and operations teams, breaking down silos.</li>
  <li><b>Scaling Issues:</b> Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates scaling of resources, enabling faster responses to growth.</li>
  <li><b>Security Gaps:</b> DevSecOps integrates security practices into the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring vulnerabilities are addressed earlier.</li>
</ul>
<h2>7. Differences Between DevSecOps, DevTestOps, and MLOps</h2>
<h3>7.1 DevSecOps</h3><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*Ap7LbDpFC8jOzR_d3ykDSA.jpeg" alt="DevSecOps" width="600">
<p>DevSecOps integrates security into every stage of the DevOps lifecycle. It ensures that security checks, such as vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, are included in CI/CD pipelines, leading to more secure software.</p>
<h3>7.2 DevTestOps</h3><img src="https://testingxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DevTestOps-Concept.png" alt="DevTestOps" width="600">
<p>DevTestOps emphasizes automated testing throughout the DevOps lifecycle. This practice ensures that quality is embedded in every stage of the development process, from code writing to production.</p>
<h3>7.3 MLOps</h3><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*vIolDB4c6B3sz1jVAYbyHg.png" alt="MLOps" width="600">
<p>MLOps is a specialized version of DevOps designed for machine learning models. It facilitates collaboration between data scientists and operations teams to streamline the deployment and monitoring of machine learning models at scale.</p>
